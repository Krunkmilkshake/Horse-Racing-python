This program will modify a program that came with our current textbook. The original program simulates a horse race using 10 horses. I now must modify this program to allow multiple people to bet on these dumb animated horses. Yay for gambling!!

More details to follow?

P.S. Check out the original code and all the files needed to run this program. Files will be located in _public.
